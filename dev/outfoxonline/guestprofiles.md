# Guest Profiles

Guest profiles in Project Outfox behave as empty profiles, which are ready for all kinds of interactions. For Outfox Online, these are used to allow content to be synced across your profiles and machines.

If the `Allow Guests` option is enabled from the Network settings screen, any player who doesn't have a player assigned beforehand is given the option to login to their OutFox Online profile via an Auth code which they can retrieve from their Outfox Online dashboard.
