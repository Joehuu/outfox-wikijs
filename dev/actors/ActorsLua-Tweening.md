Actors have the ability to transition from point A to point B using [Tweening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening).

It allows for queueing up movements & transitions on position, size, color and other attributes as well as commands and messages.

## Queueing-style tweens

These help with queueing actions after a certain amount of time.

### Sleep

The actor waits for a given amount of seconds before performing the next command.

### hibernate

Like sleep, but the actor is also hidden for the duration of the hibernate.

## Tween manipulation

These functions manipulate the flow of the tweening

## SM3.95-era tweens

These tweens are what most people would be familiar to those who work with ITG and SM3.95

<!-- We should probably create images for each variant... -->

### linear

The actor transitions at a constant rate.

### bezier

A 2D or 3D bezier curve can be passed into the function to allow for extra tweening options.

## OutFox-era tweens

OutFox added all of the standard easing functions. All of these are prefixed with `ease` and `in`/`out`/`inout`
